The Python program you have sets up a multi-agent AI coding assistant using the autogen library. Here’s a breakdown of what the program does:

🧠 Purpose
It allows a user to input any coding question, and then two AI agents—Coder and Reviewer—collaborate to answer it. The interaction mimics a developer writing code and a peer reviewing it.

---

🔁 Workflow
User Input:
You enter a coding-related question (e.g., "Write a Python function to find prime numbers.")

Agent Initialization:
Coder: AI assistant that generates code in response to your question.
Reviewer: Another AI assistant that reviews and improves the code.
User: You, represented as a proxy agent.

Agent Collaboration:
user.initiate_chat(coder, message=question) sends your question to the Coder.
Coder responds and collaborates with the Reviewer agent (since Reviewer is registered).
Together, they generate and improve the solution through agent-to-agent (A2A) interaction.

Result:
You get the AI-generated code (possibly reviewed or refined) in response to your question.

⚙️ Underlying Tech
Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or any model you configure via config_list).
Uses pyautogen, an open-source multi-agent orchestration library.
No code execution or sandboxing is enabled (code_execution_config=False), but you can turn it on if needed.

✅ Prerequisites
Install Python
Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or later
Check version:
python --version

Install required packages
First, create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Then install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

📄 Add Your OpenAI API Key
Update this line in your code with your real OpenAI API key:

"api_key": "test"  # ❌ Replace "test" with your actual key
Or better:
Use environment variables via .env and python-dotenv.

▶️ Run the Program
Assuming your script is saved as main.py:

python main.py
It will prompt:

Enter your coding question:
You can then type:
Write a Python function to calculate factorial.
Then you'll see the agents collaborate and generate the solution.

🧪 Example Output
User: Write a Python function to calculate factorial.
Coder: Here's a Python function for factorial...
Reviewer: I reviewed the code; you can improve it by using recursion...

---

📦 Example Output
The interaction flow will resemble:
* User asks: "Write a Python function for sorting."
* Coder replies with the code.
* Reviewer reviews and provides feedback.

---

📈 Future Improvements
* Enable code execution with code_execution_config=True to test generated code.
* Add logging or chat history persistence.
* Integrate domain-specific tools or APIs.
